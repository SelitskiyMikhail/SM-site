									My main activity is design. Starting from the creation of logos, advertising posters, ending with the design of magazines, editing video clips and 3D modeling. Design is a complex thing. </p>

					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>My name is Mikhail Selitskiy and I like to do beautiful things, probably the most capacious expression of what I like to do, it can be a song or a graphic, a sculpture or a performance. When a person awakens the desire to create in himself, imbued with this atmosphere. He will not stop.</p>

                    <p><img src="images/img1.jpg" style="float:left;margin:10px;">Overall, design is a ubiquitous thing. Look around, everything that you is design that people have invented, certain patterns and values and the ratio of the parameters of functionality and visuality. Even if you are in a dense forest, everything around you is a design, only it was not man who created it.</p>

                    <p>What concerns the graphic part of it. Despite many opinions, I support the fact that graphic design appeared from the moment a distant ancestor of man took coal in his hands and began to paint the history of his tribe inside the caves.So much time has passed and now we live in a world where a person knows how to transfer his voice to another person’s head at a colossal distance, where people can fly, fly to other planets, respectively, and the design does not stand still just about thirty years ago we did gardients on the poster by our hands but now...</p>
